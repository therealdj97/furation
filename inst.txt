Requirements:
1. Set up a new Express.js project with the necessary dependencies.
2. Create a MongoDB database or use an existing one.
3. Implement the following endpoints:
   - GET `/api/items` - Retrieve all items from the database.
   - GET `/api/items/:id` - Retrieve a specific item by its ID.
   - POST `/api/items` - Create a new item in the database.
   - PUT `/api/items/:id` - Update an existing item by its ID.
   - DELETE `/api/items/:id` - Delete an item by its ID.
4. Use appropriate error handling and return meaningful error messages for each endpoint.
5. Ensure proper validation of data before performing database operations.
6. Write clear and concise code with appropriate comments.
7. Implement basic error logging using a logging library of your choice (e.g., Winston).
8. Create a README file explaining how to set up and run your project.

Bonus Points (Optional):
- Implement pagination for retrieving items.
- Add authentication/authorization to protect the endpoints.
- Write unit tests for your API endpoints using a testing framework of your choice (e.g., Jest).

Submission:
1. Create a new GitHub repository with a clear name for your project.
2. Commit your code regularly with meaningful commit messages.
3. Include a README file with instructions on how to set up and run your project.
4. Submit the link to your GitHub repository as the assignment submission.

Evaluation Criteria:
- Correctness and completeness of the implemented API endpoints.
- Proper error handling and validation of data.
- Code quality, readability, and adherence to best practices.
- Effective use of Express.js and MongoDB.
- Clear and concise documentation in the README file.
